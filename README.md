# ðŸŽ® Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built with React and Vite.

## Game Logic

- The game board is a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns marking empty squares (X and O).
- The game checks for a winner after each move:
- A player wins by placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
- If all squares are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
